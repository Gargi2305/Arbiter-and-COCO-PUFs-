# Arbiter-and-COCO-PUFs-

This project focuses on building a predictive model for Arbiter and COCO-PUFs to improve secure hardware-based authentication.By utilizing LogisticRegression, RidgeClassifier, and LinearSVC with GridSearchCV for optimization, the model achieved up to 95% accuracy in classifying challenge-response pairs. The integration of signal delay calculations and multiplexers enhanced authentication security, resulting in a 20% reduction in model error and significantly improved authentication performance.
